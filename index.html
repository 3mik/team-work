        <br>
        <p>As I was going over <br>
           The Cork and Kerry Mountains <br>
            I saw Captain Farrell <br>
            And his money he was countin' <br>
            I first produced my pistol <br>
            And then produced my rapier <br>
            I said "Stand and deliver <br>
            Or the devil he may take ya" </p>
        <br>
        <p>I took all of his money <br>    
            And it was a pretty penny <br>
            I took all of his money <br>
            Yeah and I brought it home to Molly <br>
            She swore that she loved me <br>
            No never would she leave me <br>
            But the devil take that woman <br>
            Yeah, for you know she tricked me easy</p>
        <br>
